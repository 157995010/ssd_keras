# A port of [SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) to [Keras](https://keras.io) framework.
For more details, please refer to [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325).
Currently only forward pass for 300x300 model is available, please, follow `SSD.ipynb` for examples. I'm working on training stage and I plan to release it as soon as possible.

Weights are ported from the original models and are available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!7RowVLCL!q3cEVRK9jyOSB9el3SssIA).
